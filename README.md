# Kalahari: A SciolyFF Editor / Techo Demo

Given text input in the form of the
[SciolyFF](https://github.com/unosmium/sciolyff#readme), produces a standalone
HTML file of results that can be downloaded and uploaded to any static host
(e.g.  [Neocities](https://neocities.org/)).

## Notes

- Does not need an internet connection to run if the site has been visited at
  least one
- Does not run a validator, so invalid SciolyFF may still produce output
